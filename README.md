# MsBackendRawFileReader

Provides an alternative `MsBackend` to [Spectra](https://bioconductor.org/packages/Spectra) through the [rawrr](https://bioconductor.org/packages/rawrr/) package. Ultimately this backend will allow direct access to spectral data logged in ThermoFischer Scientific .raw files using accessor functions defined in the `Spectra` package (on-disk backend). 

Details of the backend concept are outlined in https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/Spectra/blob/master/man/MsBackend.Rd


## Install

Please follow the install instructions provided through 

https://bioconductor.org/packages/MsBackendRawFileReader/

## Goal

Integration of [rawDiag](https://github.com/fgcz/rawDiag) and [rawrr](https://bioconductor.org/packages/rawrr/) into the RforMassSpectrometry [Spectra](https://bioconductor.org/packages/Spectra) ecosystem.
